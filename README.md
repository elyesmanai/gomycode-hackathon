#gomycode-hackathon
The goal is to make you ready for after this training, so we'll give you a real world example to work on.
You have 4 hours to make a website for a company called "3alamni", it's a training center like GoMyCode.

It opened in Lac 1, opens from 8h to 18h, and trains in web development, this company wants you to make a website for them where people see their trainings, their prices.

Your website must contain : 
	- trainings 
	- Prices
	- Time schedule
	- Contact

Your website must be : 
	- Responsive (bootstrap)

Your website can have : 
	- Animations using CSS Transform or JavaScript.

This company has no idea how web design and web development works, and so it's your duty to make something they will love.

You can use these examples for inspiration : 
	- http://formalab.tn/
	- https://gomycode.tn/
	- https://wallstreetenglish.fr/ 

-You can use snippets (part of code to something like a menu or cool feature)  but not a complete template !
-If you like something in a template take that something out and only use that.
